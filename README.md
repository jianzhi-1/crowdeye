### Concept
Ever since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, many social distancing measures have been put into place.
However, there are still many avenues for people to go out, such as buying groceries or exercising for example.


For a runner, suppose he wants to run 10km. How should he plan his route so that he minimises contact with others along the way?
He definitely wouldn't want to take the most popular running trail in this pandemic. Hence, the inspiration for our app.

### Interface

* **hour** - input the hour that you are going out
* *Submit* - submits your inputs
* *Update Route* - update your existing route after you have taken it as data for others
* *Toggle Heat Map* - switch the heat map on or off
* *Delete* - deletes a data point
